# A Fate Episode skipper for Granblue Fantasy
## This Python script requires Selenium in order to run.

With the introduction of TikTok and other short-form content (i.e. YouTube Shorts & Instagram Reels), attention spans have fallen exponentially, mine included. 
In the browser game Granblue Fantasy, whenever you get a new character, they have their own story, called a "Fate Episode" which gives material for the Gacha pulls.
If you do the gacha often there's a high chance you have A LOT of Fate Episodes in your backlog.

Normally, when going through a fate episode you need to go through severeal different screens and click many different buttons.
With this tool, there is only a small amount of human interaction, and that's just because Granblue's website is actual awful to interact with when you aren't directly clicking on the screen. 
The only clicking you need to do is: 
  1. Logging in and making it to your Granblue Fantasy home page
  2. Hitting Enter upon completing step 1
  3a. Manually accept to view spoilers if applicable
  3b. Hit Enter upon loading into the Fate Episode
     i. This is because certain Fate Episodes take longer to load, and therefore by putting this check in the program won't break.
     
So, instead of having to manually navigate three screens and click five or so buttons, this program just requires you to pay just a bit of attention and hit (mostly) just the Enter key to clear out your backlog!

### Important Notice
Do not change the size of the browser once it opens until you're done using this program! The code breaks when this occurs.
